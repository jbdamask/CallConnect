## Call Connect
LED animations to visualize connected device "calls" and connections. To be used with my [PiHub](https://github.com/jbdamask/PiHubBleAwsIoT) IoT gateway.

## Hardware
* Feature BLE 32u4 (Microcontroller)
* Raspberry Pi 3
* Neopixels
* Button (will change to FSR in near future)

### Inputs
A local sensor, such as a button, and BLE.

### Outputs
LED animations and BLE calls


## Notes
* Change the name of the microcontroller to match what the PiHub connects to.
* Requires some standard Arduino libraries (available in the IDE's Library Manager).
